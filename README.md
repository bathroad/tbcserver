Windows Server interface to Thunderbird Calendar

Sold my IT company which used Google for more or less everything, and wished get away from 'big brother'.

Back to Thunderbird for mail, brilliant, my ISP provides IMAP, so no problem. But the calendar?

This is a straightforward project: a shared calendar for my wife and I, nothing fancy. And I am an old-fashioned programmer
(no LINQ, no Entity Framework, just client/server SQL).

This bit - with its GUI for testing - reads and writes events into the Lightning calendar SQLite database.

There were so many things that I had to look up (Stack Overflow etc.), I felt compelled to share the result.

There will be an Android client sometime soon.
